# How to Use Chips

Chips are used to either make selections, filter content or trigger actions. They should always appear as a group of interactive elements. There are four types of chips to choose from: assist, filter, input, and suggestion. It is possible to produce their respective appearances by using the variants of the Chip component.

Chips can be found in the *Assets* panel in the *Basic Input* group of components.

## Steps

1. Drag *Chip* component into an *Auto layout* of your design;
2. Select variant options;
3. Duplicate chip instance as needed (drag while holding down the option key OR copy/paste);
4. With the *Auto layout* selected, launch the Uno plugin (can also be selected after opening the plugin);
6. Under the *Properties* tab select the **Group** option from the *Layout Type* drop down menu;
7. Click the save button at the bottom of the tab.
