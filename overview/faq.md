# FAQ - Figma Plugin

## Is paid version of Figma required?

No, the free version of Figma is sufficient to use the plugin. Some Figma features are only available in the paid version, but they are not required to use the plugin.

## Is the plugin available in the desktop version of Figma?

Yes, the plugin is available in both the web and desktop versions of Figma. The usage is the same in both versions.

## Should the plugin be used while running Figma in _developer mode_ or _design mode_?

The plugin works in both modes and the features are the same. Launching it is slightly different in each mode and it is not appearing in the same place.

Using design mode, the plugin is launched from the _Plugins_ menu in the toolbar and shown in a floating window.

Using developer mode, the plugin is launched from the _Plugins_ tab in the right panel and shown in the same side panel.

## Is it possible to generate C# Markup instead of XAML?

Yes, it is possible to generate [C# Markup](xref:Uno.Extensions.Markup.Overview) instead of XAML. Directly from the _Export_ tab, select the _C# Markup_ option.

The settings will give more C# Markup generation options.

## Can the plugin generate code using controls from my own library?

Yes, it is possible to reference your own controls in the generated code. You will need to create [Custom Components](xref:Uno.Figma.Learn.Developers.CustomComponents) and you will be able to use and reuse them at will in your designs.

The previewer won't be able to render them, but the generated code will be correct and will compile. A placeholder will be rendered in the previewer.

## What is the difference between the free and paid (Pro) version of Uno Platform for Figma plugin?

All features available at the Pro/paid license are available in the free license. Only the number of screen exports is capped at 15 per month for the free version. Once that threshold is hit, you have the option to upgrade to a Pro license, which unlocks an unlimited number of exports and updates. Alternatively, you can also wait for next month’s free allocation of 15 free screens to kick in as well if you are not ready to go for the paid version.

In addition, Pro version subscribers get access to Premium support, accessible via "Settings" tab of the plugin. 

## How do I get help with Uno Platform for Figma plugin?

If you are using the free version you can access our community support at [DIscord](https://platform.uno/uno-discord)

Pro version subscribers get access to Premium support via "Settings" tab of the plugin. 

## How the plugin handles data and privacy?

Your Privacy Matters! Take a moment to explore plugin's [Data Policy](xref:Uno.Figma.Overview.DataPolicy) for detailed information on how plugin safeguards and handles your data.

## I received more than one email confirmation for my Uno Platform for Figma plugin purchase. Am I billed twice?

No, you have not been billed twice. The purchase process is currently facilitated through the Figma marketplace and Stripe, so this process is outside of our control. Stripe sends an invoice and a purchase receipt, and they sometimes send that email twice; this isn't an indicator of a double charge (hence why the receipt and invoices you receive twice have the same ID). First, notice all invoices have the same numbering, and you can double-check your bank statement to confirm there is no double charge.
