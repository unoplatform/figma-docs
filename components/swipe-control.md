### Extra Customization

> To reach the extra customization features you will need to work your way through the hierarchy of the component to find the specified sub-components.

- **Template/.SwipeControlItem**: Those sub-components include the content of one of the left or right item. The quantity of those templates is decided by the **Left items** and **Right items** proerties. Although it displays an image in the Plugin it still has two properties :
  - **Icon**: By default it is a "Heart", but it can be modified
  - **Content**: Changes the text displayed under the icon.
- **OVERLINE**: Changes the first line of text, it can be removed if hidden.
- **Subtitle**: Changes the second line of text, it can be removed if hidden.
- **Secondary Text**: Changes the last line of text, it can be removed if hidden.
